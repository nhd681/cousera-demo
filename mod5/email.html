<p><strong>Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Change,</strong></p><p><strong>Indira Paryavaran Bhawan</strong></p><div>I am aware that in March 2020, the ministry proposed a draft notification to replace the 2006 EIA. Currently, the notification is at the stage of public comments. <br /><br />I, as a citizen and an active participant of pro environmental activities, have concerns over it.</div>The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the public consultation aspect. It provides for a reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance. It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA. <br /><br />The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury. <br /><br />Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice. <br /><br />Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- Roll back on this increase in the period for filing compliance reports and decrease the period further to 4 months thus requiring the submission of 3 compliance reports every year.</p><p>A Concerned Citizen</p>
